The first thing to do is to import the relevant packages
that I will need for my script,
these include the Numpy (for maths and arrays)
and csv for reading and writing csv files
If I want to use something from this I need to call
csv.[function] or np.[function] first
'''

import csv as csv
import numpy as np
